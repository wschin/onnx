Compute one iteration of ADAGRAD, a stochastic gradient based optimization
algorithm. This operator can conduct the optimization of multiple tensor variables.
Let's define the behavior of this operator. As you can imagine, ADAGRAD requires
some parameters:
 
 - The initial learning-rate "R".
 - The update count "T". That is, the number of training iterations conducted.
 - A L2-norm regularization coefficient "norm_coefficient".
 - A learning-rate decay factor "decay_factor".
 - A small constant "epsilon" to avoid dividing-by-zero. 

At each ADAGRAD iteration, the optimized tensors are moved along a direction
computed based on their estimated gradient and accumulated squared gradient. Assume
that only a single tensor "X" is updated by this operator. We need the value of "X",
its gradient "G", and its accumulated squared gradient "H". Therefore, variables in
this operator's input list are sequentially "R", "T", "X", "G", and "H". Other
parameters are given as attributes because they are usually constants. Also, the
corresponding output tensors are the new value of "X" (called "X_new"), and then
the new accumulated squared gradient (called "H_new"). Those outputs are computed
from the given inputs following the pseudo code below.

Let "+", "-", "*", and "/" are all element-wise arithmetic operations with
numpy-style broadcasting support. The pseudo code to compute those outputs is:

```
// Compute a scalar learning-rate factor. If X is never updated, T should be 0.
r = R / (1 + T * decay_factor);

// Add gradient of 0.5 * norm_coefficient * ||X||_2^2, where ||X||_2 is the 2-norm.
G_regularized = norm_coefficient * X + G;

// Compute new accumulated squared gradient.
H_new = H + G_regularized * G_regularized;

// Compute the adaptive part of per-coordinate learning rate. Note that Sqrt(...)
// compute square root element-wisely.
H_adaptive = Sqrt(H_new) + epsilon

// Compute the new value of "X".
X_new = X - r * G_regularized / H_adaptive;
```

If one assign this operators to optimize multiple inputs, for example, "X_1" and "X_2", the same
pseudo code may be extended to handle all tensors jointly. More specifically, we can view "X" as a
concatenation of "X_1" and "X_2" (of course, their gradient and accumulate gradient should
be concatenated too) and then just reuse the entire pseudo code.

Note that ADAGRAD was first proposed in http://jmlr.org/papers/volume12/duchi11a/duchi11a.pdf.
In that reference paper, this operator is a spacial case of the Figure 1's composite mirror
descent update.

Compute one iteration of Adam, a stochastic gradient based optimization
algorithm. This operator can conduct the optimization of multiple tensor variables.
Let's define the behavior of this operator. First of all, Adam requires
some parameters:
 
 - The learning-rate "R".
 - The update count "T". That is, the number of training iterations conducted.
 - A L2-norm regularization coefficient "norm_coefficient".
 - A small constant "epsilon" to avoid dividing-by-zero. 
 - Two coefficients, "alpha" and "beta".

At each Adam iteration, the optimized tensors are moved along a direction
computed based on their exponentially-averaged historical gradient and
exponentially-averaged historical squared gradient. Assume that only a tensor
"X" is being optimized. The rest of required information is

 - the value of "X",
 - "X"'s gradient (denoted by "G"),
 - "X"'s exponentially-averaged historical gradient (denoted by "V"), and
 - "X"'s exponentially-averaged historical squared gradient (denoted by "H").

Some of those parameters are passed into this operator as input tensors and others
are stored as this operator's attributes. Specifically, this operator's input tensor
list is ["R", "T", "X", "G", "V", "H"]. That is, "R" is the first input, "T" is
the second input, and so on. Other parameters are given as attributes because they
are constants. Moreover, the corresponding output tensors are 

 - the new value of "X" (called "X_new"),
 - the new exponentially-averaged historical gradient (denoted by "V_new"), and
 - the new exponentially-averaged historical squared gradient (denoted by "H_new").

Those outputs are computed following the pseudo code below.

Let "+", "-", "*", and "/" are all element-wise arithmetic operations with
numpy-style broadcasting support. The pseudo code to compute those outputs is:

```
// Add gradient of 0.5 * norm_coefficient * ||X||_2^2, where ||X||_2 is the 2-norm.
G_regularized = norm_coefficient * X + G;

// Update exponentially-averaged historical gradient.
V_new = alpha * V + (1 - alpha) * G_regularized;

// Update exponentially-averaged historical squared gradient.
H_new = beta * H + (1 - beta) * G_regularized * G_regularized;

// Compute the element-wise square root of H_new. V_new will be element-wisely
// divided by H_sqrt for a better update direction.
H_sqrt = Sqrt(H_new) + epsilon;

// Compute learning-rate. Note that "alpha**T"/"beta**T" is alpha's/beta's T-th power.
R_adjusted = R * Sqrt(1 - beta**T) / (1 - alpha**T);

// Compute new value of "X".
X_new = X - R_adjusted * V_new / H_sqrt
```

If there are multiple inputs to be optimized, the pseudo code will be applied
independently to each of them.

Compute one iteration of stochastic gradient update with momentum.
This operator can conduct the optimization of multiple tensor variables.

Let's define the behavior of this operator. As you can imagine, SG with momentum requires
several parameters:
 
 - The learning-rate "R".
 - The update count "T". That is, the number of conducted training iterations. It should
   be zero in the first training iteration.
 - A L2-norm regularization coefficient "norm_coefficient".
 - A decay coefficient of previous accumulated gradient (i.e., momentum) "alpha".
 - The scaling coefficient of current gradient "beta".
 - An attribute to choose either standard momentum or Nesterov's momentum "mode" should
   be used.

For the sake of simplicity, assume that there is only one tensor (called "X") to be optimized.
Other necessary inputs are "X"'s gradient (called "G") and "X"'s momentum (called "V"). This
Momentum operator maps all these inputs to the new value of "X" (called "X_new") and its new
momentum (called "V_new").

This operator supports two different momentum algorithms. Set the attribute "mode" to
"nesterov" if Nesterov's momentum is desired. Otherwise, set the attribute "model" to
"standard" to use standard momentum. Computation details are described subsequently.

Let "+", "-", "*", and "/" are all element-wise operations with numpy-style broadcasting.

Pseudo code for SG with standard momentum:

```
// Add gradient of 0.5 * norm_coefficient * ||X||^2, where ||X|| is the sum of squared
// values of all elements in X.
G_regularized = norm_coefficient * X + G

// In the first training iteration, beta should always be 1.
beta_adjusted = T > 0 ? beta : 1

// Compute the current momentum based on previous momentum and the current gradient.
V_new = alpha * V + beta_adjusted * G_regularized

// Update X.
X_new = X - R * V_new
```

Pseudo code for SG with Nesterov's momentum:

```
// Add gradient of 0.5 * norm_coefficient * ||X||^2, where ||X|| is the sum of squared
// values of all elements in X.
G_regularized = norm_coefficient * X + G;

// In the first training iteration, beta should always be 1.
beta_adjusted = T > 0 ? beta : 1

// Compute the current momentum based on previous momentum and the current gradient.
V_new = alpha * V + beta_adjusted * G_regularized;

// Compute final update direction and then update X.
X_new = X - R * (G_regularized + alpha * V_new)
```

If one assign this operators to optimize multiple inputs, for example, "X_1" and "X_2". The same
pseudo code would be extended to handle all tensors jointly. More specifically, we can view "X" as a
concatenation of "X_1" and "X_2" (of course, their gradient and accumulate gradient should
be concatenated too) and then our pseudo code becomes applicable.

Gradient operator computes the partial derivatives of a specific tensor to
some other tensors. This operator is widely used in gradient-based training
algorithms. To illustrate its use, let's consider a computation graph,

```
X -----.
       |
       v
W --> Conv --> H --> Gemm --> Y
                      ^
                      |
                      Z
```

, where W and Z are trainable tensors. Note that operators' attributes are
omitted for the sake of simplicity. Let dY/dW (dY/dZ) be the gradient of
Y with respect to W (Z). The user can compute gradient by inserting Gradient
operator to form

```
W --> Conv --> H --> Gemm --> Y
|      ^              ^
|      |              |
|      X              Z
|      |              |
|      |   .----------'
|      |   |  (X/W/Z is the 1st/2nd/3rd input of Gradient as shown in "xs")
|      v   v
'---> Gradient(xs=["X", "W", "Z"], y="Y") ---> dY/dX (1st output of Gradient)
       |   |
       |   '-----------------------------------> dY/dW (2nd output of Gradient)
       |
       '---------------------------------------> dY/dZ (3rd output of Gradient)
```

, where the content inside the braces of Gradient are attributes. The attribute
"xs" specifies the necessary inputs to compute the variable specified by
attribute "y". To compute gradient, the runtime should identify a sub-graph with
inputs specified by "xs" and outputs containing "y"'s content and do a backward
pass (or other auto-differentiation techniques whenever needed).

Since X is not trainable tensor, the user can avoid the creation of dY/dX by
assigning an empty string to the 1st output name of that Gradient. In other
words, all Gradient's outputs are optional. Note that the concept of optional
outputs can also be found in ONNX's RNN, GRU, and LSTM.

Gradient operator can compute derivative against intermediate tensors. For
example, the gradient of Y with respect to H can be done in

```
W --> Conv --> H --> Gemm --> Y
       ^       |      ^
       |       |      |
       X       |      Z
       .-------'      |
       |   .----------'
       |   | (H/Z is the 1st/2nd input of Gradient as shown in "xs")
       v   v
      Gradient(xs=["H", "Z"], y="Y")
       |   |
       |   '-----------------------------------> dY/dH (1st output of Gradient)
       |
       '---------------------------------------> dY/dZ (2nd output of Gradient)
```

It is possible to represent high-order differentiation using Gradient operator.
An example for linear model is

```
W --> Gemm --> Y --> Loss --> O
       ^              ^
       |              |
       X              L
```

To compute the 2nd order derivative of O with respect to W (denoted by
d^2O/dW^2), one can do

```
W --> Gemm --> Y --> Loss --> O
|      ^              ^
|      |              |
|      X              L
|      |
|      |
+------+--> Gradient(xs=["X", "W"], y="Y") ---> dO/dX (1st output of Gradient)
|      |      |
|      |      '---> dO/dW (2nd output of Gradient)
|      v
'---> Gradient(xs=["X", "W"], y="dO/dW") ---> d(dO/dW)dX (1st output of
       |                                          Gradient)
       |
       |
       '---> d^2O/dW^2 (2nd output of Gradient)
```

When the inputs of Gradient are the tensors named in "xs", the computation
can be optimized. More specifically, a forward pass can be reused if the
gradient is computed via reverse-mode auto-differentiation.
We can feed different tensors to the identified graph. For example, one
can compute the gradient of Y with respect to H by substituting Y_1 into Y
and H_1 into H.

```
W --> Conv --> H --> Gemm --> Y
       ^              ^
       |              |
       X              Z

           Z_1 (the 2nd input of Gradient)
           |
           v
W_1 --> Gradient(xs=["H", "Z"], y="Y") ---> dY/dX when Y = Y_1
         |   |
         |   '-----------------------------------> dY/dW (2nd output of Gradient)
         |
         '---------------------------------------> dY/dZ (3rd output of Gradient)
```
